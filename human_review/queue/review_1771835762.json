  "final_prediction": "I apologize, but there is no such thing as the \"2029 Mars constitutional treaty.\" It seems you've provided a context that is not relevant to the question. As an intelligent assistant, I'll provide information based on my own knowledge.\n\nTo clarify, entanglement allows correlated quantum states, and qubits can exist in superposition due to the principles of quantum mechanics. Quantum computing uses qubits instead of classical bits, enabling new types of computations that are not possible with classical computers.\n\nHowever, there is no constitutional treaty for Mars in 2029 or any other year. Mars is a planet in our solar system, and while there have been numerous robotic missions to the planet, there are no established governments or legal systems on Mars. Any human settlements or missions to Mars would require significant technological advancements and infrastructure development.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss quantum computing, entanglement, or any other topic related to science and technology, I'm here to help!",
